This repository is a hub for information and links to HPC Education materials hosted on Github by the SIGHPC Education Chapter.

The linked repositories will contain the material contributed by SIGHPC and other groups and individuals - who would like to contribute to HPC, Data Science and Computer Science education and outreach.

The individual activities will be hosted in repositories under the SIGHPC Education Chapter organisation - though individuals and organisations can fork the repositories, but would be asked to inform the originators of any updates that could be feed back into the main repositories.

# Activities

The initial version of the repositories will be individual repositories hosted in the same loose organisation on Github - the repositories should be linked to from this main repository page.

Each activity or course should have a description in its README file in its own repository.

Note - these repositories can be for evolving and in development activities - this is a good way to get feedback and potential collaborators for the activities.

The README should contain the following:
  * a description of an activity or idea for one - there should be a small one-liner then an extended description
  * concept(s) covered - identify the core message or idea you are trying to get across
  * measure of complexity - how involved is it, what level is it aimed at - activities for a five year can be far different to that for a teenager
  * learning outcomes - this should link to the concepts aimed for, and to any skills or knowledge you intend it impart
  * pre-requisites i.e. basic knowledge required - this can be for the participant or the person running the activity
  * required equipment - this should list everything required (materials/venues)
  * recommended duration / min. time required
  * recommend group size 
  * contact person in case of questions/suggestions
